## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

1. **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**: Ensure your Raspberry Pi is running the latest version.
2. **Ansible**: Install Ansible on your local machine.
3. **Cloudflare-managed domain**: Required for dynamic DNS updates and subdomain routing.
4. **Ethernet connection**: Use a wired connection for your Raspberry Pi for stable performance.

> [!Important]
> When flashing your SD card, enable SSH and select the `Use password authentication` option.

> [!Note]
> If you choose a custom hostname or user, remember to update the `inventory.ini` file accordingly.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Nitestack/raspberry-pi-5.git ~/raspberry-pi-5

2. **Install required Ansible Galaxy collections**:

    ```sh
    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
    ```

3. **Configure Your Server**: Follow the steps in the [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) section below to set up your variables.

4. **Run the playbook**:

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook deploy.yml
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This only works if you have set up password-less SSH authentication on your Raspberry Pi. Please look at the [Security](#%EF%B8%8F-security) section for more details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

This project uses Ansible's best practices for variable management, separating public configuration from private secrets.

### 1. Public Configuration (`group_vars/all/main.yml`)

This file contains all non-sensitive configuration for your server, such as domain names, ports, and feature flags. Open `group_vars/all/main.yml` and customize the settings to match your environment.

### 2. Secret Management (`group_vars/all/vault.yml`)

All sensitive data (API keys, passwords, secrets) is stored in an encrypted Ansible Vault file. For convenience, we will store the vault password in a local, git-ignored file.

**To set up your secrets:**

1. **Create your vault password file:** Create a file named `.vault_pass` in the project root containing only your vault password.

```sh
echo "YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_VAULT_PASSWORD" > .vault_pass
chmod 600 .vault_pass # Set restrictive file permissions (read/write for your user only)
```

2. **Create and fill your vault:** Copy the `vault.yml.example` file to `group_vars/all/vault.yml`, fill in your secrets, and then encrypt it. Ansible will automatically use your `.vault_pass` file.

```sh
cp vault.yml.example group_vars/all/vault.yml # copy template

# -- NOW, EDIT group_vars/all/vault.yml AND ADD YOUR SECRETS --

ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/all/vault.yml # encrypt file
```

## üîå Port Forwarding

To ensure remote access and proper functionality, configure the following port forwarding rules on your router. The playbook will automatically configure the server's firewall (UFW) based on these variables.

```plaintext
# Caddy (handling all websites and APIs)
public:80/tcp -> local:80/tcp
public:443/tcp -> local:443/tcp
public:443/udp -> local:443/udp

# WireGuard (value from 'vpn_port' in main.yml, default is 51820)
public:{{ vpn_port }}/udp -> local:{{ vpn_port }}/udp

# SSH (optional, if you want to access the Pi with a URL)
public:22/tcp -> local:22/tcp
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

### 1. Add Your Host to Authorized Keys on the Raspberry Pi

To enable secure, password-less SSH access for Ansible, copy your public SSH key to the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
ssh-copy-id your_user@your_pi_ip_or_hostname
```

### 2. Update SSH Configuration

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the Raspberry Pi to disable password authentication and strengthen security. Update the following settings:

```plaintext
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
```

### 3. Reload the SSH Service

Apply the changes by reloading the SSH service:

```sh
sudo systemctl reload ssh
```

## üíæ Backups

This setup includes an automated backup solution using **Restic** and **Rclone**.

- **Remote Backups**: Stored on OneDrive or Proton Drive

Backups are performed daily via a cron job and can also be triggered via the "Backup" GitHub Actions workflow.

### Configuration

1. **Install `rclone`** on your local machine.
2. **Configure `rclone`**: Run `rclone config` and follow the steps to set up a new remote.
3. **Update `vault.yml`**: Fill in your secrets (`rclone_...`). You can get the config by running `rclone config show <your_remote_name>`.
