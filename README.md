## üöÄ Features

> [!Warning]
> This setup requires your domain to be fully managed by Cloudflare DNS.

- **Automated Docker installation**
- **Vaultwarden deployment** for secure password management
- **Cloudflare DDNS updater** for dynamic IP management
- **PiVPN (WireGuard)** configuration for secure remote access
- **NextCloud** for file synchronization and sharing
- **Immich** for media synchronization with fast-upload speeds
- **Home Assistant** for home automation and IoT management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

1. **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**: Ensure your Raspberry Pi is running the latest version.
2. **Ansible**: Install Ansible on your local machine.
3. **Cloudflare-managed domain**: Required for dynamic DNS updates and subdomain routing.
4. **Ethernet connection**: Use a wired connection for your Raspberry Pi to ensure stable performance.

> [!Important]
> When flashing your SD card, enable SSH and select the `Use password authentication` option.

> [!Note]
> If you choose a custom hostname or user, remember to update the `inventory.ini` file accordingly.

5. **Static IPv4 configuration**: Your Raspberry Pi should have a static IP on your local network. To set the IP to `192.168.2.210`, use:

   ```sh
   sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses "192.168.2.210/24" \
     ipv4.gateway "192.168.2.1" \
     ipv4.dns "192.168.2.1" \
     ipv4.method manual && \
   sudo nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"
   ```

   This is a one-time setup. The Ansible playbook will manage IP persistence afterward.

> [!Note]
> Ensure Avahi is installed and running for `.local` domain resolution. Alternatively, access the Pi using its IP address directly.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Nitestack/raspberry-pi-5.git ~/raspberry-pi-5
   ```

2. **Install required Ansible Galaxy collections**:

   ```sh
   ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force # to ensure the latest versions
   ```

3. **Run the playbook**:

   ```sh
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This only works if you have set up password-less authentication on your Raspberry Pi. Please look at the [Security](#-security) section for more details.

## üîå Port Forwarding

To ensure remote access and proper functionality of the services, configure the following port forwarding rules on your router:

```plaintext
# PiVPN (WireGuard)
# PIVPN_PORT is an environment variable configurable in `secrets.yml`. The default value is `51820`.
public:${PIVPN_PORT}/tcp -> local:${PIVPN_PORT}/tcp

# Caddy (handling all the websites)
public:443/tcp -> local:443/tcp
public:443/udp -> local:443/udp
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Variables

To securely configure sensitive data, create a `secrets.yml` file in the root directory. Copy the `secrets.example.yml` file and populate the fields as required.

### Cloudflare DDNS Updater

Ensure that an `A` record for your domain is set up, initially pointing to a placeholder IP (e.g., `8.8.8.8`). The DDNS script will update it with your public IP. Define the record name in `secrets.yml` under `CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME`.

### PiVPN Configuration

Add a `CNAME` record for your PiVPN subdomain, pointing it to the value in `CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME`. Update the `PIVPN_DOMAIN` variable in `secrets.yml` with the correct domain.

### Vaultwarden Settings

Create a `CNAME` record for your Vaultwarden subdomain, directing it to the value specified in `CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME`. Set the `VAULTWARDEN_URL` variable in `secrets.yml` to your Vaultwarden URL.

### NextCloud Settings

Create a `CNAME` record for your NextCloud subdomain, directing it to the value specified in `CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME`. Set the `NEXTCLOUD_URL` variable in `secrets.yml` to your NextCloud URL.

### Immich Settings

Create a `CNAME` record for your Immich subdomain, directing it to the value specified in `CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME`. Set the `IMMICH_URL` variable in `secrets.yml` to your Immich URL. In addition to that, please set your timezone id (TZ identifier) with `TIMEZONE` (check this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List)). You also have to set a database password with `IMMICH_DB_WORD` (only use the characters `A-Za-z0-9`, without special characters or spaces).

### Home Assistant Settings

Create a `CNAME` record for your Home Assistant subdomain, directing it to the value specified in `CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME`. Set the `HOME_ASSISTANT_URL` variable in `secrets.yml` to your Home Assistant URL.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

### 1. Add Your Host to Authorized Keys on the Raspberry Pi

To enable secure SSH access, copy your public key to the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
ssh-copy-id nhan@raspberrypi.local
```

### 2. Update SSH Configuration

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the Raspberry Pi to strengthen security. Update the following settings:

```plaintext
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
```

### 3. Reload the SSH Service

Apply the changes by reloading the SSH service:

```sh
sudo systemctl reload ssh
```
